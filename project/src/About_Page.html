      Today, about more than 50% of the people don't have a budget.  We spend our money on unnecessary things. The problem with this is that it can really add up over the course of decades,
      which can really impede the retirement of many people.
      It is also reported that over 75% of full time workers in the US are living paycheck to paycheck. Many of these people have too many expenses.
      The worst case scenario is that people can go bankrupt because they don't know how to handle their money.

      <br> <br>

      In order to help, we have a financial app called GoSave.  With GoSave, we can help assist you with your finances.
      By using our app, we can help make your finances easy to follow and maintain.
      How this app works is that we will total up and sort how much you spend every time you make a purchase.
      When you are done with your purchases we will store your data into a database in our app.

      Here is the Great News!  We understand that you would feel lazy to input your spendings, so we implement a feature where you can take a photo
      of your receipt and using our image processing software it will populate the categories that you have spent your money on.
      After using your data we can then calculate average spending based on location to determine you are overspending or not.
      That's not all! we also implement a savings feature where you can set a certain item you want to save for.
      Our app will tell you how much you need to save each week and for how long.

      <br> <br>

      By using our app we gurantee that you will not have anymore financial problems in your life.  So why not give it a try!
